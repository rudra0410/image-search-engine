## Image Similarity Search Engine
A deep learning-based image similarity search engine that uses EfficientNetB0 for feature extraction and FAISS for fast similarity search. The application provides a web interface built with Streamlit for easy interaction.

Features
- Deep Feature Extraction: Uses EfficientNetB0 (pre-trained on ImageNet) to extract meaningful features from images
- Fast Similarity Search: Implements FAISS for efficient nearest-neighbor search
- Interactive Web Interface: User-friendly interface built with Streamlit
- Real-time Processing: Shows progress and time estimates during feature extraction
- Scalable Architecture: Designed to handle large image datasets efficiently
